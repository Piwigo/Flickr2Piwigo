      Photos that already exist in Piwigo will not be imported.

    <p>
      The comparison is done firstly on the filename (for a match to "<code>flickr-&lt;Flickr_ID&gt;</code>")
      and then on the checksum of the actual image file.
      Note that no metadata is updated for photos already imported.

    <p>
      Flickr supports <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.dates.html">approximate dates</a>
      for "date taken" attribute of photos.</p>
    <p>
      These will be imported as exact dates, and an <code>approximate date</code> keyword added
      as well as keywords for
      the date (e.g. <code>c. 1933</code>, <code>March 2008</code>, or <code>1986</code>)
      and granularity (one of: <code>month</code>, <code>year</code>, <code>circa</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a date taken on Flickr of "c. 2006" will be imported with a date of "2006-01-01 00:00:00"
      and keywords "approximate date", "circa", and "c. 2006".
